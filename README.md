# National Undergraduate Engineering Training Integration Ability Competition
Designed an unpowered car(convert gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy) with the ability of avoiding walls and obstacles automatically. This resposite is used to optimize design of the car and simulate the track the car would run. [guijitu.m](/guijitu.m) is used to stimulate the track on which the car will follow
